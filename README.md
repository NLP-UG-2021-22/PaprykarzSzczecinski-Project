# PaprykarzSzczecinski-Project
This repository is a simple web application project for the **web development** course. It is based on a [Bechdel Test](https://bechdeltest.com/), which measures the representation of women in film according to the following criteria: (1) it has to have at least two women in it, (2) who talk to each other, (3) about something besides a man. Our **Bechdel Bot** allows the user to check if the movie of their choice passes or fails the test. Additionally, with the use of [MoviesDatabase API](https://rapidapi.com/SAdrian/api/moviesdatabase/details), the bot can provide information about the movie, such as the release year, language, genres, rating, and plot. The bot can even tell the user if the movie is worth watching on the basis of the rating.
